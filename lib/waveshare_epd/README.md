## Notes

### Inconsistent naming of width and height

The screen-specific code snippets in this directory suffer from inconsistent naming of the width and height parameters.

For example, on screns with a 2.7" diagonal, the width is the long side, and the height is the short side.
Comparatively, on screens with a 2.9" diagonal, the width is the short side, and the height is the long side.
